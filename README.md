# Numbered Folder Sorter

basically sorts a number of files into numbered Folder.
it's almost completely random how it sorts the files.
this script is for archiving intended where you dont really care where the files are.
it only sorts folders that are only numbers. it will ignore any folder with any non digit character in it (except if you input a source folder)

Only Tested on Windows.

just start the script and follow instruction.

example: folder 1 has 4240 files and you specify that every folder only needs 1000 files
this script automatically creates new folders (1, 2, 3, 4,...) and sorts a random choosen file into the next "empty" filder until it hits 1000. 

DISCLAIMER: i have no idea how to optimize this since this is my first python script.
