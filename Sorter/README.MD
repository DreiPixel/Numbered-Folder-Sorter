# Numbered Folder Sorter

basically sorts a number of files into numbered Folder.

just start the script and follow instruction.

example: folder 1 has 4240 files and you specify that every folder only needs 1000 files
this script automatically creates new folders and sorts them. 

DISCLAIMER: i have no idea how to optimize this since this is my first python script.
